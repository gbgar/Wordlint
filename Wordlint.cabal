name:                Wordlint
version:             0.2.1.0
synopsis:            Plaintext prose redundancy linter.

description:         Wordlint locates matching pairs of words repeated within a user-defined
                     distance.  Text may be linted by distance between words (that is, by word
                     count), by line count, and/or by percentage of the total words in the file.
                     For details on running the program, see README or the included man page.

                     Internally, Wordlint separates a text file (or stdin) into
                     a list of "Words", after processing user flags. An instance of the "Word"
                     datatype consisting of a String that contains a lemma; its line and column
                     coordinates; and its "position": an Int or Float depending on the type of check
                     invoked by the user.

                     This list is first filtered by the user-defined minimum
                     length of the lemma. Next, items are matched by their lemma and exclusive
                     coordinates before being added to a list of "Wordpairs", a data structure
                     containing two Words and the difference between their respective "positions".
                     If multiple types are specified, all Int positions are converted to the Double
                     type and the resulting lists are intersected to produce the final results.
                     Finally, these Wordpairs are optionally filtered by the difference in their
                     positions (another user-specified option). All remaining Wordpairs are
                     processed for printing to stdout in machine-readable (default) or
                     human-readable format. Plugins exist for integration with Vim 
                     (https:\/\/github.com\/gbgar\/Wordlint.vim) and Emacs
                     (https:\/\/github.com\/gbgar\/wordlint.el).
